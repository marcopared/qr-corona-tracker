<h3>Introduction</h3>
  Our ideas for this project stemmed from the desire to help others feel some semblance of control during this time. With the feeling of an invisible threat looming every time people leave the house, we wanted to allow for a way to trace the virus between communities and anonymously alert others of potential contact. The entire world is reeling and struggling to adjust to a new virus that could potentially stick around, a lengthy quarantine, and the subsequent anxieties and heightened emotions. Our hope has been to make an app that will give users reassurance and a sense of stability as we all navigate through new policies and this tragic threat.

<h3>Purpose and Motivation</h3>
  With the high contagion risk of coronavirus, many are scared for their health and the health of their loved ones. Even if everyone were to obey social distancing as much as possible, sometimes going out can be unavoidable. Whether going to a park alone or to buy groceries, the unknown concern and risk associated with leaving one’s home can be overwhelming. Contact Tracer allows users to have more assurance and knowledge regarding whether or not there has been community spread of coronavirus to them. 

  One of the most common questions recently when speaking to health care workers is “have you had recent contact with a person with diagnosed coronavirus?” This can oftentimes be a difficult question to answer because of the possibility that one unknowingly came into contact with a person that has COVID-19 or that a family member was diagnosed and did not come forward about their results. By scanning a QR code at stores and other public locations, Contact Tracer will allow for users' locations to be saved and, in the event that they are diagnosed with COVID-19, they can alert Contact Tracer. Contact Tracer will then alert all users that they have come into contact with an anonymous individual that was diagnosed with COVID-19. A benefit to this is that it will also encourage users to stay inside if they have had contact with anyone that ended up being diagnosed with coronavirus, thus preventing further spread.

<h3>Step-By-Step Instructions</h3>
1. Open the app

2. Go to a store or other public location and scan the designated QR code for every public location that you go to 

3. If you are diagnosed with coronavirus, push the button that claims that to notify everyone that has either possibly been in direct contact with you or has been in indirect contact with you via crossing paths in certain locations over a two week time period. This data is stored in order to track community spread because those individuals may have been in contact with anything you touched while you were in a public location

4. The app is also useful if you are not diagnosed with COVID-19. It will alert you if  someone you were in contact with ended up being diagnosed with coronavirus. This is why it is important to turn on notifications. 

<h3>Team Member Roles and Contributions</h3>
- Philip Emmanuele: This was my first time working with both Android App Studio and the coding language of Java. Therefore, I took more time to do tasks that weren’t very complicated. During this project, I mostly worked on coming up with ideas as well as various front end tasks. For example, I implemented the code that made the “twitter” page of our app possible and accessible. In addition, I also implemented the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. 

- Delilah Jacobsen: My primary contributions were writing the non-coding related portions of our app and the design of our logo. In regards to the writing I did, the majority of the work revolved around researching COVID-19 to produce a section within our app about the effects of COVID-19 and relevant questions that any users may have. To produce our finalized logo, I drew a total of 4 different designs to give our team options to decide on. From there, I edited and finalized the logo based on our predetermined color scheme.

- Marco Paredes: My roles in the project included building the front-end and making both the menu and loading screen. I also assigned roles to every team member, first making sure they learn the material before implementing it. Leading an engineering team for the first time was nerve racking. I didn’t know what I was doing in the beginning and how to organize meetings or lead discussions, but it all turned out well at the end.

<h3>Difficulties and Challenges</h3>
  Some of us didn’t (or still don’t) know how to code in Java so that was a major challenge we faced. We were able to overcome this through individuals teaching themselves how to code through research, such as looking up Java-teaching programs, and by messing with the code to see how it worked and what different tweaks resulted in. Since many functions were initially unknown and foreign, we had to look up many of them and try to manipulate them to work in the way that we wanted. The hardest part was the Java-specific syntax, but by playing with it and taking Android Studio’s suggestions, we were able to produce code that did not contain any errors.
